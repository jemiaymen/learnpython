# Python Basics

## Description

### Why Python ?

What makes Python so popular is its **simplicity**. In Python, you can write much less code than in other languages such as Java or C#. In short, coding in Python is quick and efficient. There are also nearly 150,000 third-party Python libraries that you can use for all kinds of purposes.


### What are the requirements ?

First, you must install python on your pc, please check the link : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Second, you must install IDE. I prefer visual code (VSCode), please check the link : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### What this course will teach you ?

*   Commenting and Documenting Python code
*   Create your first Python application: print() text and numbers; accept input() from users
*   Use variables and math in Python: understand integers, floats and strings; apply basic mathematical operators; convert between variable types
*   Make decisions with conditional statements: write "if" statements with "elif" and "else"; use comparison operators; join multiple conditions with "and", "or" and "not"; create nested ifs
*   Repeat code multiple times using loops: write "for" and "while" loops; use "for" loops with range() and strings; write infinite "while" loops; apply nested loops; introduce "break" and "continue" instructions
*   Write functions to make your code reusable: create functions with and without parameters; define returns values; use default argument values; understand the "None" type; apply the "pass" instruction; document functions

### Who should take this course ?
*   Students taking entry-level classes in Python
*   Academics who want to leverage Python in their fields of study
*   Anyone who wants to start programming with no prior experience
*   People interested in data science and machine learning
*   Anyone interested in starting a software development career
*   Anyone who wants to automate their work
